# TP-CNN-Lenet-5
Objective of the Lab: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the LeNet-5 architecture, adapted for multiclass classification of Tifinagh characters using the AMHCD dataset.
The dataset contains 28,182 images of size 64Ã—64 pixels, distributed across 33 classes representing the Tifinagh alphabet.
The implementation should be done in Python and must include a description of the underlying mathematical formulas used in the model.
